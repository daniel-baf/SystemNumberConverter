Convert from source base to decimal (base 10 ) by multiplying each digit with the base raised to the power of the digit number (starting from right digit number 0):

decimal = ∑(digit×basedigit number)
Convert from decimal to destination base: divide the decimal with the base until the quotient is 0 and calculate the remainder each time. The destination base digits are the calculated remainders.
